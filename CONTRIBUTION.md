# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our AI-Powered Form Builder! We welcome all contributions, whether they are ideas, suggestions, bug fixes, or feature implementations.

## Open for Ideas and Suggestions
We are open to discussions and new ideas that can improve the project. Feel free to create an issue or start a discussion to share your thoughts.

## Issue-Based Workflow
- All work will be managed through **GitHub Issues**.
- Before an issue is assigned, please **comment on the issue** with your intention to work on it and provide a **time estimation**.
- The estimated time helps us track progress and maintain an active development process.
- If the estimated time passes, we expect at least a brief update from the assigned contributor.
- This ensures that contributors remain engaged and prevents issues from being abandoned without notice.

## Pull Requests
- Once your work is completed, submit a **Pull Request (PR) to the main branch**.
- In the future, we may introduce a dedicated **development branch** for staging changes before merging into the main branch.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working together on this project!
